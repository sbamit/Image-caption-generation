# Image-caption-generation
Experiment with 2 Deep Learning based models for generating captions of given images.

In this project, we have conducted an empirical study of two Deep Learning based Image Caption Generation models and showed their comparative performances, by experimenting on the well known Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO datasets. From the BLEU-4 scores of the
models, we can learn about their efficacy in generating image captions in languages understandable to humans
